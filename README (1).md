# Entity

An “entity” refers to something that exists as a distinct and independent unit. An entity contains attributes, which describe that entity. So anything about which we store information is called an entity. Entities are recorded in the database and must be distinguishable, i.e., easily recognized from the group.
For example: A student, An employee, or bank a/c, etc. all are entities.

 # TYPES OF ENTITY:

.Tangible Entity

.Intangible Entity

# Tangible Entity:

A tangible entity is a physical object or a physical thing that can be physically touched, seen or measured.for example, a student or an employee,physical goods or physical products.

# Intangible Entity:

Intangible Entities are those entities which exist only logically and have no physical existence. Example: Bank Account

# Entity Type:

The entity type is a collection of the entity having similar attributes. In the above Student table example, we have each row as an entity and they are having common attributes i.e each row has its own value for attributes Roll_no, Age, Student_name and Mobile_no. So, we can define the above STUDENT table as an entity type because it is a collection of entities having the same attributes.

# Types Of Entity Type

•	Strong Entity Type

•	Weak Entity Type

# Strong Entity Type
A strong entity is an entity that is not dependent on any other entity. It has a primary key, or a table includes a primary key.
A simple example of a Strong Entity is the Employee which has the key attribute 'Employee ID,' using which a record of that Entity Type is uniquely identified. 

# Weak Entity Type

a weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone; therefore, it must use a foreign key in conjunction with its attributes to create a primary key.  

A weak entity is one that can only exist when owned by another one. For example: a ROOM can only exist in a BUILDING. On the other hand, a TIRE might be considered as a strong entity because it also can exist without being attached to a CAR.
